# Solar-Panel-I-V-Characteristics-Analysis

Designed and implemented a measurement system using Arduino UNO, INA219, and voltage sensors to capture real-time I-V characteristics of photovoltaic panels.

Automated resistive load variation via a transistor-controlled ladder network to analyze PV response under different conditions.

Generated I-V curves using Excel and MATLAB to extract key performance metrics such as Isc, Voc, and MPP for optimizing solar panel efficiency.
